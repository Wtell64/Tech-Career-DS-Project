# Tech-Career-DS-Project

This is a simple project I did for the Tech Career Data Science Bootcamp. This project was done for simple demonstration and much more can be done to improve the analysis.

Things to improve given time:
- Transform the independent variables depending on the skewness
- Do model tuning for each model
- Make a more elaborate exploratory data analysis
- Use an MLP to also assess the performance of an simple neural network
- Outlier detection
